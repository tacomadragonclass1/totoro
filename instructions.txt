HOW TO RUN YOUR GAME
====================

Since modern browsers have security restrictions, you cannot simply double-click "index.html" to run the game. You need a local server.

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2. Go to the Extensions view (click the square icon on the left sidebar or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
3. Search for "Live Server".
4. Install the extension "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey.
5. Once installed, go back to your file explorer in VS Code.
6. Right-click on "index.html".
7. Select "Open with Live Server".

Your default browser will open, and the game should start!
